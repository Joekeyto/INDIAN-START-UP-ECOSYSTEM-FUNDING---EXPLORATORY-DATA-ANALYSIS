## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, we are going to analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Data for each year of funding is located in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files are the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

As Data Analysts for this project, we are required to explore the datasets, clean and prepare these datasets, analyze the final prepared dataset and tell compelling stories with intuitive and appropraite visualizations
